#Fitness Progam

The included documents outline, to the best of my ability, an attempt to create a program that will accomplish the following goals:
- **Work**: The program must actually get results. I personally, do not have the time to go down paths that will not produce positive health benefits.
- **Be Sustainable**: The program must be simple enough that I can continue to participate in it, even if my schedule changes and/or the time I have available to exercise shrinks. 
- **Non-Destructive**: Intense workouts are appealing, and they can get dramatic results. Any program that I utilize must not damage my ability to be a functioning adult for my family, and for my employer. Injuring myself for a workout program is not an option.
