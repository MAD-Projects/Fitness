#Fitness Progam

The included documents outline, to the best of my ability, an attempt to create a program that will accomplish the following goals:
- **Work**: The program must actually get results. I personally, do not have the time to go down paths that will not produce positive health benefits.
- **Be Sustainable**: The program must be simple enough that I can continue to participate in it, even if my schedule changes and/or the time I have available to exercise shrinks. 
- **Non-Destructive**: Intense workouts are appealing, and they can get dramatic results, if you have the resources to dedicate to keeping yourself healthy. However, they also have an increased risk of injury. Any program that I utilize must not damage my ability to be a functioning adult for my family, and for my employer. Injuring myself for a workout program is not an option. 

Keeping these goals in mind, my attempt with these documents is to great a customizable program that is flexible enough to adapt when needed to the ever changing demands of life.
