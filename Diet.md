My Fitness Pal Diet
"One of the big takeaways," says Silliman, is that "although we thought we might see that people were eating fewer carbohydrates or less fat, we didn’t. We didn’t even see them eating significantly fewer calories."

Instead, they ate a lot more fiber—29% more, to be exact. In terms of overall carbs, the successful users ate around the same as the rest of us, but they ate more cereals (17% more), possibly of a fibrous kind.

Successful dieters also ate a lot less meat (11%) and eggs (13%), but upped their protein and fat in other ways, including more yogurt (11%), and more almonds (10%). They also ate a lot more olive oil than other users. While the overall trend is down, with 12.3% less olive oil in diets, the super users consumed 10% more than the average.

> In short, the numbers show that the most successful weight-losers are following the best current dietary advice. Lots of olive oil, lots of raw fruit, vegetables such as cauliflower, less meat but still a good amount of protein, and don’t worry about fat—one of my favorite figures is that these successful users eat way more full-fat Greek yogurt (13%) than regular dieters.
